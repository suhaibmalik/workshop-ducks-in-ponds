# Day 3: Test for Ducks in Ponds

## Instructions

Complete the application so that every duck is tested against every pond in `data.json`.

You may define the constraints of a pond and a duck as you please: Different rules may present different results for whether a duck is in a pond or not and that's fine.
Explain and justify your rules in the comments

You may also format your results/output in any way you like.

Focus on as high test coverage as possible.

## Hint

There's a bug in the point package
